# Glossary of AML & CTF Compliance Acronyms & Definitions 
_A repo of Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter Terrorist Financial (CTF) compliance jargon._

Greetings AML Nerds, AML Haters and everyone in between! We (the team at [Outlier](https://outliercanada.com)) have put together this repo to document, clarify and grow the insane amount of acronyms, definitions and other related jargon that exists. Please feel free to submit Pull Requests for additional definitions where you do, or more importantly don't, know the answer. 

This has been designed with a North American focus, but if you are so inclined to provide European, Asian or Moon related PRs, we can evolve this repo into something really powerful.
