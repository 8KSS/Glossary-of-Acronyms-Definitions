# Glossary of Privacy Compliance Acronyms & Definitions 
_A repo of Privacy related compliance jargon._

Greetings Privacy Nerds, Privacy Lovers and information seekers! We (the team at [Outlier](https://outliercanada.com)) have put together 
this repo to document, clarify and grow the insane amount of acronyms, definitions and other related jargon that exists. Please feel 
free to submit Pull Requests for additional definitions where you do, or more importantly don't, know the answer. 

This has been designed with a North American focus, but if you are so inclined to provide European, Asian or Moon related PRs, we 
can evolve this repo into something really powerful. Where a definition is followed by a bracket, this specifies the source of the definition E.G. - (GDPR). Where there is no source provided, the information came from PIPEDA.
