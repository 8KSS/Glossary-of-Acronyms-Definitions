# Glossary-of-Acronyms-Definitions
A repo of Anti-Money Laundering (AML), Counter Terrorist Financial (CTF) and Privacy jargon

Greetings AML Nerds, AML Haters and everyone inbetween! We (the team at Outlier) have put together a repo to document, clarify and provide the insane amount of acronyms, definitions and other related jargon that exists. This has been designed with a North American focus, but if you are so inclined to provide European, Asian or Moon related PRs, we can evolve this repo into something really powerful.
