A repo of Anti-Money Laundering (AML), Counter Terrorist Financial (CTF) and Privacy compliance jargon.

Greetings AML Nerds, AML Haters and everyone inbetween! We (the team at Outlier) have put together a repo to document, clarify and provide the insane amount of acronyms, definitions and other related jargon that exists.

# Beneficiary:

# Business Relationship: 
A business relationship is a relationship established between you, as a reporting entity, and a client to conduct financial transactions or provide services related to those transactions.

Account-based business relationship: You are automatically in a business relationship with a client that holds an account with            you.
     
A business relationship begins as soon as you open an account for a client. Under the business relationship you must consider all       transactions and activities relating to that account, as well as any other accounts that the client might have with you.
Non-account-based-business relationship: If a person or entity does not have an account with you, a business relationship is            formed once you have conducted two transactions or activities for which you have to:

•	verify the identity of the individual; or

•	confirm the existence of the entity.
